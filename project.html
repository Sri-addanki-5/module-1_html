		<li>Duration of the project: 3days</li>
		<li>Catehory: Minor</li>
		<li>Platform: Python,Gui,Tkinter,cmu basic graphics</li>
		<li>Brief description: It is minor project game designed based on our own interest. This game is all about a between two player,<br> the player randomely choose an option to move on numbers but the numbers are only upto 100 who will reach the value upto 100,<br> then winner will display on with help of we was using Gui,<br> The user has to download the VS code and install in his/her system. Open the source code. select the difficulty level. Play the game and have fun.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Duration of the project: 3days</li>
		<li>Category:Major</li>
		<li>Platform:Java</li>
		<li>Brief descriftion: It is a Major project where we were asked to implement collinear points mechanism using Queues and stacks.<br> The collinearity of a set of points is the property of their lying on a single line.<br> A set of points with this property is said to be collinear (sometimes spelled as colinear.<br> In greater generality, the term has been used for aligned objects, that is, things being "in a line" or "in a row"..</li>

	<h4> Project Name: Conway's Game Of Life</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Duration of the project:7 days</li>
		<li>Category: Major</li>
		<li>Plaform: Java Eclipse</li>
		<li>Brief descriftion: It is a major project where we were asked to build Conway's Game Of Life Using its conditions. The Game of Life, also known simply a Life, is a cellular automation devised by<br> the British mathematician Johan Hoorton Conway in 1970. It is a Zero-player game, meaning that is evolution is determined by initial state, requiring no further input.<br> One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and obsering how it evolves.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Duration of the project: 7 days</li>
		<li>Category: Major</li>
		<li>Platform: Sublime and python</li>
		<li>Brief description: In this project I developed Rsa and sha algoritham and using private and public keys used to encryption and decryption process, <br>in this transactions were happening only identity and the sender his transaction hash id is transfer to reciever and Qr code option have used to<br> make more transaction on third party persons and every time qr_id will generate, this entire process is safe and more reliable secure to transfer the cryptocurrency.</li>
